This project, Hiredo, is a web application that provides a platform for hiring workers for various tasks such as homeworker, cook, home cleaner, watchman, baby sitter, laundry man, and more. The application will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, and Node.js technologies and will be fully responsive. To ensure a consistent user experience, the application will utilize the Bootstrap framework.

In terms of data management, Hiredo will use two databases: Firebase and MongoDB. Firebase will be used to store user data such as login information and preferences, while MongoDB will be used to store information about workers, their skills, and availability.

The application will feature a search function that allows users to search for workers based on various criteria such as location, availability, and skills. Users will be able to view worker profiles, read reviews left by previous customers, and message workers directly through the application. Once a user has found a worker they would like to hire, they can book the worker through the application and make payment using the integrated payment gateway.

Hiredo aims to provide a simple and user-friendly platform for both workers and customers to connect and streamline the process of finding and hiring workers for various tasks.
